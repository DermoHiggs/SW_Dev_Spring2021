/* Try the following:
        *      1: Instantiate an instance of the class, i.e. an object, from another class (in the
        *          same package) that contains the main() method.
        *          Use system.out.println() to verify that the object has the correct values in it.
        *      2: In main() try to modify publicVar2 via the object that you created.
        *          Can you do it?
        *          print again to verify.
        *      3: In main() try to modify privateVar1 via the object that you created.
        *          Can you do it?
        *          What do you think you might do, if you need privateVar1 to remain private but you would
        *          like to be able to modify it from outside the class, e.g. from main().
        *      4:  Call the printTotal() method from main() and verify that it works as expected.
        *          What happens if you change its access specifier to private?
        *      5: Try to change the access modifier of the class from 'public' to 'private'
        *          What happens? Can you speculate on why this is happening?
