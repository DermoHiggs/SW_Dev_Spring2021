This package contains a solution to the Dog, Labrador, Yorkshire exercise.

It's not great, but nonetheless it is a solution (because it works!)
1:  I use a magic number for the breed weight in Yorkshire - I could have
    easily overcome this with a similar solution to Labrador, though.

2:  The fact that they both have avgBreedWeight() as a method would suggest that it is a valid case for
    inheritance, i.e. that the Superclass might have a version of this method and then the two subclasses would
    override it.
